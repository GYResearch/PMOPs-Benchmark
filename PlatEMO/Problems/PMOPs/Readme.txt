%% For the evaluation, 

%% KneeRefPoF is the reference points in the knee regions of the PFs for the knee %% benchmarks regarding to the parameters in the paper.

%% trueKnee is the given true knees of the benchmarks regarding to the parameters %% in the paper.

%% KneeMetrics includes three knee-driven indicators for the evaluations of the %% knee search or identification.

%% You can set another parameters in PMOPs and the way how to get the reference %% points and true knees in the knee regions is presented in the paper.
